                <strong>Fingering:</strong>
                <br />The placement of the fingers may seem alien at first. It is probably easiest to get used
                to if you just look at the basic principles involved. You ideally want clean direct contact between your
                finger tip and the fret board on top of the string. It is important to know that you are not putting
                your finger on top of the fret itself! You are ideally placing your fingertip a depressing the string
                against the fret board just behind the fret. In the chord charts it looks like the fingertip is placed
                midway between the frets, but that is not actually going to work well at all. Another important point is
                that your leverage against the string will be best if you can achieve a contact point that is nearly
                perpendicular to the fret board.<br /><br />

                <strong>Holding a
                    Pick:</strong>
                <br />You do not need to do the pinch of death when holding a pick. You want just enough pressure to
                keep it in your grasp, but not so tight that you can't glide across the strings. This of the pick as a
                surfboard and the strings as the waves. You just want a clean smooth glide. You are not trying to saw
                the strings in half!<br /><br />
                <div>
                    <img src="../images/hand-placement.jpg" alt="picture of D chord tab" />
                    <strong>Hand
                        Placement:</strong>
                    <br />The ideal hand placement is with the outer heal of your hand resting lightly against the
                    outside of the bridge of the guitar near the soundhole and pick-guard. The outside of the wrist can
                    be kept bouncing against the bridge as you strum, just try not to interfere too much with the
                    strings (unless of course you are working on more percussive strumming!)
