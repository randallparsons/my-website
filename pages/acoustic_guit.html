                    <h2><strong>Fingering:</strong></h2>
                    <p>The placement of the fingers may seem alien at first.&nbsp; You ideally want clean direct contact
                        between
                        your finger tip and the fret board on top of the string.&nbsp; It is important to know that you
                        are
                        not putting your finger on top of the fret itself!&nbsp; You are ideally placing your fingertip
                        and
                        depressing the
                        string against the fret board just behind the fret.&nbsp; Too close to the fret and you will
                        deaden
                        the string, but too far back and you will get string-buzz.&nbsp; Another important
                        point is that your leverage against the string will be best if you can achieve a contact point
                        that
                        is nearly perpendicular to the fret board.

                    <h2><strong>Holding a Pick:</strong></h2>
                    <p>You do not need to do the pinch of death when holding a pick. &nbsp;You want just enough
                        pressure to
                        keep it in your grasp, but not so tight that you can't glide across the strings.&nbsp; Think of
                        the pick as
                        a
                        surfboard and the strings as the waves. &nbsp;You just want a clean smooth glide. &nbsp;You are
                        not trying to
                        saw
                        the strings in half!

                    <h2 id="clear_hands"><strong>Hand Placement:</strong></h2>
                    <p>The ideal hand placement is with the outer heal of your hand (up through the line of the outside
                        of your pinky) resting lightly against the
                        outside of the bridge of the guitar near the soundhole and pick-guard.&nbsp; The outside of the
                        wrist
                        can
                        be kept bouncing against the bridge as you strum, just try not to interfere too much with the
                        strings (unless of course you are working on more percussive strumming!)
