                                This chart represents the fret board as if you were holding it right in front of your
                                face.&nbsp; The darker line on the top of this diagram represents what we call the
                                "nut". This is
                                similar to the bridge
                                at the other end of the guitar (where the soundhole is), but the nut is the end of
                                the neck
                                farthest from the body of the guitar which connects to what is called the "head" (which
                                is where the
                                tuning machines are located.)
                                <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horizontal lines represent the six guitar
                                strings from the lowest
                                note string on the left to the highest
                                pitch string to the right.&nbsp; The frets are the horizontal lines, and are numbered
                                starting
                                from the nut to
                                fret&nbsp;#1, and this chart goes up to fret&nbsp;#5.&nbsp; Depressing a string at a any
                                fret
                                will produce a note that is a semi-tone higher than it would at the nearest fret that is
                                closer to the nut, and
                                likewise, would create a note that is a semi-tone lower than the nearest fret one the
                                other side
                                closer to the bridge.&nbsp; You can see
                                once
                                you know your way around a
                                little just how
                                simple and direct a representation this is.&nbsp; You don't really need to know anything
                                about
                                music to be
                                able to look at a chart such as this and figure out how to place your fingers to make a
                                chord!

                <h2><strong>Open Strings, "The Grid", and the First Position:</strong></h2>
                <p>The placement of the fingers may seem alien at first.&nbsp; You ideally want clean direct contact
                    between
                    your finger tip and the fret board on top of the string.&nbsp; It is important to know that you are
                    not putting your finger on top of the fret itself!&nbsp; You are ideally placing your fingertip and
                    depressing the
                    string against the fret board just behind the fret.&nbsp; Too close to the fret and you will deaden
                    the string, but too far back and you will get string-buzz.&nbsp; Another important
                    point is that your leverage against the string will be best if you can achieve a contact point that
                    is nearly perpendicular to the fret board.

                <h2><strong>Open Chords and Positions Up&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Down the Neck:</strong></h2>
                <p>You do not need to do the pinch of death when holding a pick. &nbsp;You want just enough
                    pressure to
                    keep it in your grasp, but not so tight that you can't glide across the strings.&nbsp; Think of the
                    pick as
                    a
                    surfboard and the strings as the waves. &nbsp;You just want a clean smooth glide. &nbsp;You are not
                    trying to
                    saw
                    the strings in half!

                <h2><strong>Full / Partial Bar Chords and Chord Fragments</strong></h2>
                <p>The ideal hand placement is with the outer heal of your hand (up through the line of the outside of
                    your pinky) resting lightly against the
                    outside of the bridge of the guitar near the soundhole and pick-guard.&nbsp; The outside of the
                    wrist
                    can
                    be kept bouncing against the bridge as you strum, just try not to interfere too much with the
                    strings (unless of course you are working on more percussive strumming!)
