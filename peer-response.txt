Joshua Hicks:

1.) Image widths: On the guitars webpage, I did notice the image of the guitar was overflowing from the main content area at least when the browser was maximized. When the width of the browser is much smaller, the image fits perfectly within the content area. Possibly including a media query for the image, when the browser is maximized, could resolve this simple image overflow.

Documented Response:  I previously was using float right for this image only to find it did not respect boundaries at all.  I since made it an element in a flex box with the article, now it behaves.  Ultimately this graphic will be marked up to point out and name the various parts of the guitar on the side, while the article has pictures and descriptions of how to approach playing.


3.) Readability: After a specific window width has been met, the media query makes the paragraph font size relatively small and potentially hard for some people to read. I'd suggest possibly increasing the font size a bit more than what it is set to at a smaller window width.

Documented Response:  I redid the first page and set all new CSS, so now the text does not zoom too small.
