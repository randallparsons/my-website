        <h2>Approach the mysteries of the Guitar with Confidence</h2>
        <p>Ever wonder how some musicians make the guitar look so easy? No doubt it comes down to a

            a simple way to communicate the complexities of the musical aspects of guitar with a simple visual language?
            Well guess what?</p>
        <h2><em>...There is!</em></h2>

        <p>Your interest in guitar tab assumes that you may already have access to a guitar of some
            sort.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternately, you may not have one yet, but you are interested.
